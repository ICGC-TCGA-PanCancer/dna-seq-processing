# DNA sequencing reads processing

This repository keeps a collect of data processing tools for DNA-Seq. All tools are defined using Common Workflow Language (CWL).
Eevery tool is self-sufficient, can be independently developed, tested, released and used. This clean isolation allows maximum flexibility, maintainability and portability.
